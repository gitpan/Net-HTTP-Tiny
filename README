NAME

Net::HTTP::Tiny - minimal HTTP client

DESCRIPTION

This module provides an easy interface to retrieve files using the HTTP
protocol.  The location of a file to retrieve is specified using a URL.
The module conforms to HTTP/1.1, and follows redirections (up to a limit
of five chained redirections).  Content-MD5 is checked, if the optional
module Digest::MD5 is installed.  IPv6 is supported, if the optional
module IO::Socket::IP is installed.  Only retrieval is supported, not
posting or anything more exotic.
